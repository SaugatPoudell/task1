# task1

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

i have used Provider.http for decoding the JSON file and not much things are used 
the Weather api is called and the image is not png but i didnt edit it to make it a better border
also there seems to be 1/2 seconds of error scrren shown when the api is not fetched so i couldnt find a solution to it 
and i try to meet the requirement of the task
